# eternalopposites-rewrite
Working on re-doing the time-waster that was Eternal Opposites.
Teaching myself a different language, as well.

Pairs I remember are:
Love hate
Life death
Male Female
Peace War
Sunner winter
Day night
Good evil
rich poor
Spring fall
Yin-Yang (one is always at the apex, on in a random location)

Update - Thankks to the local library selling off old computers, I now have access to the original files! I will add these as time permits.

there is a db to hold the tiles and their relationships
